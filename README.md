# SUS-Data-Analytics
The objective of the project is to be able to open DBC files, the standard format of SINAN, and transform them into a table, converting the encodings according to the data dictionary.

It will analyze notifications of accidents involving venomous animals, which are made available by DATASUS through the link https://datasus.saude.gov.br/acesso-a-informacao/doencas-e-agravos-de-notificacao-de-2007-em-diante-sinan/, where there are several databases available.

At the end of the project, there will be a data transformation and analysis notebook that can be adapted for other files available from SINAN.
